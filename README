# Configuration of RaspberryPi server

Shall use of docker-compose/docker as much as possible to
* allow update of services to e.g. current PHP versions independent of host system (security!)
* allow migration by using the same software versions on different machines

Expects a /var/nextcloud directory. Subfolders might be generated by scripts?
Secrets should be in unmanaged .env files to allow putting this on github

The Raspberry makes use of two attached hard drives for file storage and backup purposes.

Contains
- nextcloud (+ mariadb, nginx, collabora, redis)
- influxdb2
- SBFSpot
- letsencrypt
- zigbee2mqtt

TODO
- integrate smarthome stuff?
